                I am a rising sophomore learning computer science. I came into this industry not knowing much and always felt like I was behind and can't compete with the others. This site includes resources, programs, and internships that are suited for underclassmen. These helped me both learn skills needed to land an internship and also allow me to explore the different types of jobs in this field.

                    <p class="header"><a href="https://www.opcollege.org" target="_blank">Opportunity College Web Develpment</a></p>
                    <p class="box">This is a free online program teaching you Web Develpment from scratch. I really like this program because they cover not only the technical skills needed for the workforce but also include many soft skills that are useful in the workplace. I was in the part time program and I felt that the pacing was a bit fast and the summer one is even more intensive. This program is a lot of work and you really need to be self deciplined and dedicated or you will fall behind. Overall a 10/10 program because it gets you career ready.</p>

                    <p class="header"><a href="https://www.codepath.org/" target="_blank">Codepath</a></p>
                    <p class="box">This is a free online program for college students. They offer many different semester long sessions focusing on different fields. They have many different programs including: Cybersecruity, Web Development, Intro to Software Engineering with Python, Interview Prep and many more. These programs usually have a lot more people so expect a bunch of self studying. This is good because they offer many different levels of the sessions based on your skill level. Being in Codepath also gives you access to all their career resources like the Emerging Engineer Summit which allows you to meet a lot of big tech companies and connect with recruitors.  </p>
